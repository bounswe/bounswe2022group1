# Executive summary

**Summary:** As of now, our backend, frontend, and android are all functioning and able to communicate with each other. We have implemented all of the required functionalities but events and semantic searching. After experiencing issues with our product during the second milestone, the team decided that it was more important to focus on implementing annotations and refining existing functionalities related to learning space and resources rather than adding new ones. The backend team successfully implemented annotations according to W3C standards, improved existing functionalities, and created the endpoints requested by the frontend and android teams. The frontend team also made significant progress, implementing numerous functionalities including image and text annotations. The android team made substantial improvements as well, including a significant change in style and the creation of a user-friendly app with a nice design. 

**Status of Deliverables:** We finished all the requirements for the deliverables and submitting as of now. 

**Final Release Note:** After much effort and dedication, we were finally able to present a fully functional frontend, android, and backend. The process was challenging and required a significant amount of hard work and personal sacrifices, including long hours and moments of exhaustion. Despite these challenges, we are extremely happy and proud of the end result. It was a true team effort and we are grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project together. We hope that as customers, you will be just as happy and proud to use our application, Budemi.

* Now we have a functional frontend and android and we support image and text annotations on the frontend. 
* We have an easy to use UX/UI that facilitates learning process. 
* We have a markdown support for both frontend and android. 
* All in all, we have a functional application that is ready to use. 


**Changes our team has made:**  After recognizing the challenges in the frontend team, we decided to move Mustafa from the backend to the frontend to help. Mustafa made a significant contribution and played a crucial role in creating a functional and visually pleasing frontend. Not only Mustafa, but the rest of the frontend team also put long hours of hard work to bring the application to success. The lack of Mustafa from the backend team resulted in a heavier workload for the remaining team members (2 members). Similarly, the android team, consisting of only two people, worked hard and put in long, exhausting hours to create a nice product. Despite these challenges, our efforts paid off and we were able to create a nice, working application.

**Reflections:** I think responsibility and conscientiousness are crucial qualities in group work. It is important for team members to be reliable and follow their commitments in order to ensure the success of the project. These traits help to create a positive and productive team dynamic and can make a significant difference in the outcome of the work. In the third milestone, we saw firsthand the positive effects of these traits on our success.

**What could be done differently:** It could be beneficial to have stricter deadlines for presenting completed work. For example, if we had tracked our progress on a weekly basis as a team, we could have identified any shortcomings in our product much earlier on, before the first and second milestones. This could have let us to solve any issues more thoroughly and potentially prevent them from becoming more significant problems during the milestone 1 and 2. By having more frequent controlls, we could more closely monitore our progress and could made any necessary adjustments earlier on.

## Annotations

We have successfully implemented text and image annotations on the web version of our application using the Recogito.js and Annotorious.js libraries, which ensure compliance with W3 standards. Users can create, update, and delete annotations, as well as reply to existing ones. In contrast, implementing annotations on the Android version was more challenging due to the lack of Kotlin libraries, so annotations are currently not available on that platform. We have designed a visually appealing user interface that fits with our theme and placed a strong emphasis on user experience in the design of the annotations. In addition, we have implemented a simple cache system to reduce API calls and ensure that annotations are fully synchronized with our backend.

## Standards

We implemented annotations in both the backend and frontend, following W3C standards. In the backend, we created a separate application, completely separate from the main backend app for annotations. Moreover, we store the annotations adhering to W3C standards. The frontend also adheres to the same standards to use W3C web annotations.   In addition, the backend team wrote their APIs in a way that adheres to REST standards, making it easier for the mobile and frontend teams to use our endpoints. By adhering to these standards, we were able to facilitate the adoption of our APIs by other teams.

## Unit tests

Unit tests are a crucial aspect of software development as they aid in verifying that code is functioning correctly and as intended. By writing these tests, we can confirm that our code is correctly performing its intended tasks and correctly handling unexpected input or error conditions. This can ultimately save time and effort by identifying bugs early on and preventing them from becoming larger problems later.

Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a comprehensive toolkit for building REST APIs within the Django web framework. It offers a variety of useful features and utilities that make it easier to construct APIs, including support for serialization, authentication, and permissions.

One advantage of using DRF is that it includes built-in support for testing APIs. The APITestCase class, which we utilize in our unit tests, is a subclass of Django's TestCase class that is specifically designed for testing APIs. It provides a number of useful methods for sending HTTP requests and examining responses, as well as creating and deleting a database for testing purposes.

Thanks to Django Rest Framework, we have implemented unit tests for the post, get, and patch methods of our endpoints. As a backend team, we have implemented unit tests for the following features:
* Register
* Login
* Logout
* Content
* Discussion
* Note
* Discussion list
* Learning space
* Reset password
* Change password
* Enrolled learning spaces
* Leave learning space
* Learning space list
* Favoriting a learning space
* Unfavoriting a learning space
* User from id
* User from username
* Annotation


# Software Package

## Deployed Software
Our frontend software is deployed at http://budemii.space/  an the backend software is deployed at: http://3.89.218.253:8000/. The annotations server is running at  http://3.89.218.253:8001/. 


## Final Release
The final release is accessible from there: https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/releases/tag/customer-presentation-3

In the link above, there is no frontend, since frontend had merge conflicts. They merged their code 2 days ago. Here is our updated final release with the inclusion of frontend: https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/releases/tag/customer-presentation-3-update . Since it is an update, the tag name is customer-presentation-3-update and release is v0.9.1 instead of v.0.9.0

## Instructions for building

### For Building Backend App

-> Checkout master branch

-> Enter into the directory "backend". 

-> You should be in the same directory as docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile. Type:

-> sudo docker-compose build

-> sudo docker-compose up

Now, your app shoould be running. Note that, if the docker app's ports are already taken, then you should update the ports in docker-compose.yml. Also, you should have a .env file in the same directory where your docker-compose.yml file is located. In this file, you need e-mail and password specifications, which we didn't publish here. So, for learning them, please communicate with us. 



### For Running Frontend App in Development Mode

-> Enter into the directory "frontend". 

-> npm i

-> npm run dev

**Unit Tests:** I haven't implemented any unit tests. Since UI/UX depends on human interaction and endpoints are already tested by backend team, we did manual testing for possible cases.

Milestone1:

We had meetings constantly with the android team and helped each other a lot during the development.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Milestone2:
</summary>

We had many meetings during the development process and helped each others a lot. We splitted works should be done until the milestone 2 during these meetings, but some pages were not implemented. As a team we tried to complete those pages, for me, I implemented forgot, change password page and search page for learning spaces additionally. Further, we could have been more prepared for the milestone2. We will try harder for the next milestone.

Final Milestone:
</summary>

It was my and other android team members' first time dealing with Kotlin. We had tough times through the development process of this project. As a good side, I am now at a nice level of developing android applications by using Kotlin though I don't prefer it. However, we failed to implement annotations functionality no matter how hard we try. This mainly because of we are not familiar with Kotlin and its tools. Another possible factor is that we started as 4 people on android team, but at the end of the day we were 2 people. Maybe, we could have managed the process better and devoted more time to implement annotations. On the other hand, we have improved our UI and UX a lot since the Milestone 2. These improvements were so satisfying for us. Besides these technical difficulties, developing a software product with other team members gave me lots of ideas about my future career. I learnt a lot about working with a team, its difficulties and advantages. To sum up, it was tough and enlightening process, and I am as thankful as I am exhausted.

</details>

**Main Contributions:**

<details>
<summary>Milestone 1</summary>

I have made further contributions while initializing the project. I dockerized the backend project. I took a role while selecting the tech stack we will use as a team. Moreover, I updated the fundamental features page, added Udemy courses to our group account, and prepared project plan and API documentation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Milestone 2</summary>

I was responsible for implementing the initial models, serializers, update method, and image uploading for the project. I took the lead in researching and learning about these areas in Django, which helped make the work of my teammates easier. In addition, I actively participated in weekly meetings and played a key role in determining the frontend UX and backend design for the project.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Milestone 3</summary>

After failure of web during the milestone 2 presentation, I switched from the backend team to the frontend team because I had more experience with React than other members of the backend team. I wanted to contribute to the team by creating a new UI and bringing the Android and frontend teams together under one theme. In addition to updating the UI, I also worked to improve the organization of the team and followed up with each member's progress, including HÃ¼seyin Seyid Kaplan, to meet deadlines. On the technical side, I implemented fully functional text and image annotations that followed W3 standards, and also helped the backend team implement the annotations API. I believe my efforts in the frontend team had a significant impact in milestone 3 and also had a positive influence on backend and android teams.

<summary>Milestone 1</summary>

I had been working on this project and fulfilling my responsibilities as expected since the beginning of the class. I took further responsibility while creating initial Django project and application. However, I had a family-related urgency last week of the Milestone 1 deadline (27.10.2022 - 30.10.2022) and had to return to my family house. Unfortunately, I couldn't contribute a lot during that period.

<details>
<summary> Milestone1: </summary>

It was difficult to determine in which language and platform we will do the project. My suggestion was to develop in flutter and I had flutter experience, but in the meeting, we decided to develop the project in kotlin and android studio. But since no one knows about kotlin and android studio, I researched courses about kotlin and android studio and shared them with my team.

</details>
<details>
<summary> Milestone2: </summary>

I tried to develop a new architecture for android because the existing application had a lot of bugs and it was prolonging the code development process. Like other groups, a new architecture was needed for a better and more beautiful-looking application, but there was not enough time to migrate all the code to the existing architecture before the presentation. However, I have uploaded my enhancements to the android_main branch.

</details>
<details>
<summary> Final Milestone: </summary>

My friends in android team deleted all branches related to android and opened a new branch. Since I was not asked anything while doing these operations, all the codes that I had developed in milestone 2 were deleted. At the same time, I pushed the codes I developed one after another and the other people in the android team saw that there was a conflict when they made a pull request that they did not update the branches they were working on while developing the code. Instead of resolving Conflict, they preferred to revert my codes. That's why I noticed that my enhancements were deleted and they didn't tell me about it. Still, I opened a new branch called android_final_milestone, all my codes and apk file are located here.

Milestone1
</summary>


**Responsibilities:** I was responsible for learning how to use Django and dockerize the Django application. After the learning process, my task was dockerizing the Django application. Additionally, I was responsible to learn Django Rest Framework. Besides, one of my tasks was to find a tutorial to implement login, logout, and register functionalities.

**Main Contributions:** Following [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) tutorial, I learned how to construct a Django application and developed a basic Django application. I then dockerized this application. I built a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file to dockerize the Django application. Then I presented the dockerized application to my teammates and then we decided to deploy this version of the project. After the dockerization and deployment process to connect the backend to the frontend and android, we decided to use Django Rest Framework. It was my responsibility to add the rest API feature to our application. I have learned how to use the Django Rest Framework and added this feature to our application. After that, we decided to push our project to Github. I created a new Django application with proper application and project names. Then dockerized this application and added the Rest Framework feature. Then we pushed this project to Github. Finally, we had to create login, logout, and register functionalities for our application. For that purpose, we first needed to learn how to implement these functionalities. I searched and tried lots of tutorials to implement these functionalities. Finally, I found [this](https://studygyaan.com/django/django-rest-framework-tutorial-register-login-logout) tutorial and suggested to the backend team to follow this tutorial. We followed this tutorial and implemented login, logout, and register functionalities.

**Main Contributions:**
As a member of the Budemi backend team, I was responsible for a range of tasks that contributed significantly to the success of the application. I implemented several API endpoints, including those for taking and editing notes and updating user profiles. These features were crucial to the functionality and usability of the application. Additionally, I was responsible for debugging and resolving issues, such as the bug that prevented users from seeing other users' notes. I also created meaningful learning spaces and added resources to these learning spaces on the deployed application, which helped us to present a more realistic application. In addition to these implementation tasks, I played a vital role in the review process, providing valuable feedback and guidance on my team member's pull requests and issues. I also contributed to the team's preparation for the final milestone presentation by participating in meetings and collaborating with my teammates. Overall, my contributions were instrumental in the successful development and deployment of the Budemi application.

**Unit Tests:**
Unit tests are an essential part of the software development process, and are particularly important for the backend of our application Budemi. By writing unit tests for the backend, we can verify that the code is doing what it's supposed to do and that it is handling edge cases and error conditions correctly. This can help us catch bugs early on and prevent them from becoming more serious issues down the line. In addition, unit tests can make it easier to maintain and update the backend code over time, as we can use them to ensure that changes don't break any existing functionality. Overall, unit tests are an important tool for ensuring the quality and reliability of the backend of our application, and are well worth the effort to implement.

- I implemented unit tests for the profile endpoint
- I implemented unit tests for the note endpoint
- I implemented unit tests for the getting user id endpoint

* [Unit tests for profile page, taking notes feature and getting user id](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/pull/849)
* [Unit test for profileApiView patch method is implemented](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/pull/860)


**Additional Information:**
Despite facing the challenge of losing one of our team members to the front-end team, the back-end team was able to successfully implement all of the planned functionalities for the Budemi application.  Despite the setbacks, our backend team (me and Ege) was able to stay focused and motivated and was able to deliver a high-quality product on time. This achievement is a testament to the team's dedication and hard work and is a testament to the team's ability to adapt and overcome challenges. Additionally, I was in active communication with front-end and mobile teams and provided the necessary endpoints when they requested them.

**Unit Tests:**
We haven't written any unit test. Since UI/UX testing is done via human computer interaction and back-end already written unit-tests for their apis, we have done it manually for all possible cases.

**Additional Information:**<br>
It was my and other android team members' first time dealing with Kotlin. Since Kotlin is a compiled language not an interpreted one, it is hard to develop apps in a short amount of time. We had tough times through the development process of this project. As a good side, I am now at a nice level of developing android applications by using Kotlin though I don't prefer it. However, we failed to implement annotations functionality no matter how hard we try. This mainly because of we are not familiar with Kotlin and its tools. Another possible factor is that we started as 4 people on android team, but at the end of the day we were 2 people. Maybe, we could have managed the process better and devoted more time to implement annotations. On the other hand, we have improved our UI and UX a lot since the Milestone 2. These improvements were so satisfying for us. Besides these technical difficulties, developing a software product with other team members gave me lots of ideas about my future career. I learnt a lot about working with a team, its difficulties and advantages. To sum up, it was tough and enlightening process, and I am as thankful as I am exhausted.

**Unit Tests:**
Since frontend testing is done via human computer interaction, I haven't coded any unit test. 

**Additional Information:**
I actually noted what I have done in this [link](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/wiki/Kadir-Gokhan-Sezer). This link can also be used to track my work.

**Member:** Ege Onur TaÄŸa, Group1, Backend, Online Learning Project (OLP) - Budemi, [Personal Page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/wiki/Ege-Onur-Taga)

**Responsibilities for Milestone 3:** 
* I was responsible for bug fixing in the profile page (when user enrolled and then disenrolled, our backend still showed her as enrolled). 
* I was responsible for implementing a functionality to favorite and unfavorite learning spaces (app/favorite and app/unfavorite). 
* I was responsible for bug fixing the favorites functionality (a user could favorite the same learning space multiple times).
* I was responsible for implementing annotation support in the backend (separate project running on a different endpoint). 
* On top of that, I was responsible for creating a project and deploying it into AWS EC2 for annotation support.
* I was responsible for fixing the bug in the patch method of profile page. 
* I was responsible for meeting with my team members to discuss the customer milestone 3. 
* I was responsible for reviewing my team member's pull requests and issues. 
* I was responsible for implementing editing content.

* I was responsible for integrating our final backend software to master. 
* I was responsible for preparing API endpoint docs for the endpoints I have written. 

 
**Main Contributions for Milestone 3:** The backend team at Budemi (consisting of me and Kadir Kalkan) worked really well together and were super organized. We were able to create a bunch of endpoints that made things easier for the frontend and mobile teams, and it was all because we had such a strong team dynamic. We all helped each other out and learned from each other throughout the project. My specific responsibilities included implementing and bugfixing the codebase, annotations, and deployment. I've listed my contributions below for you to check out.

* I bug fixed the profile page (when user enrolled and then disenrolled, our backend still showed her as enrolled).

**Unit Tests for Milestone 3:**
  
From first milestone until the second milestone:

* I have prepared unit tests for  content.
* I have prepared unit tests for edit content.
* I have prepared unit tests for favoriting a learning space.
* I have prepared unit tests for unfavoriting a learning space.
* I have prepared unit tests for user from id.

* You may check their codes in this [PR](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/pull/858) and for the Annotation: [PR](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group1/pull/861). 

As part of my development process, I made sure to write unit tests for all of the code that I created. This was an important step to ensure that the code was working properly and met the desired specifications. By writing these unit tests, I was able to catch any errors or issues before the code was deployed, leading to a smoother and more efficient development process.


**Additional Information for Milestone 3:** I assisted the frontend and android teams by providing online support to help them utilize our APIs. Despite having comprehensive documentation, there were times when they required further explanation and clarification on certain points. To ensure that they were able to use our APIs effectively, I made myself available to answer their questions and provide guidance as needed.
